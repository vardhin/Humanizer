# VHumanize

**VHumanize** is a web-based tool for transforming AI-generated text into natural, human-like content and detecting AI-generated text. It provides advanced paraphrasing, rewriting, and AI detection features, leveraging state-of-the-art NLP models and a modern Svelte frontend.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **AI Detection**: Detects AI-generated content at line and sentence levels, with visual highlighting and detailed statistics
- 🔄 **Humanization Pipeline**: Two-step process (Paraphrasing + Rewriting) to convert AI text into more human-like writing
- 🤖 **Multi-Model Support**: Choose from multiple transformer-based models (T5, BART, Pegasus, etc.) for paraphrasing and rewriting
- ⚡ **Enhanced Mode**: Optionally use advanced prompts and NLP techniques for higher-quality rewriting
- 🔬 **Combined Humanize & Verify**: Instantly humanize text and check for AI traces in a single workflow
- 📋 **Copy & Share**: Easily copy results to clipboard
- 📱 **Responsive UI**: Clean, modern interface built with SvelteKit and Vite

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 16+
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vardhin/vhumanize.git
   cd vhumanize
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**
   ```bash
   # Install Python dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Download required models
   python download_models.py
   
   # Start the backend server
   python main.py
   ```
   The API server will start at `http://localhost:8080`

3. **Frontend Setup**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to frontend directory
   cd frontend
   
   # Install Node.js dependencies
   npm install
   
   # Start the development server
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## 📡 API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `/paraphrase_only` | Paraphrase text with selected model |
| `/rewrite_only` | Rewrite text for humanization |
| `/paraphrase_multi` | Paraphrase with multiple models |
| `/paraphrase_all` | Paraphrase with all available models |
| `/highlight_ai` | Highlight detected AI-generated sentences/lines |
| `/humanize_and_check` | Humanize and verify in one step |
| `/models` | List available models |
| `/health` | Backend health check |

## ⚙️ Configuration

- **Model Selection**: Choose or recommend models for paraphrasing/humanization
